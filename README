Project to simulate genetic and macroevolutionary algorithms
============================================================

Platform to simulate algorithms to maximize/minimize functions using AI techniques.
(Beta release, just educative package)

To execute this application be sure that you have installed  :
	python+2.7
	python-scitools
	python-matplotlib
	wxPython
	wxGTK2.8
	
In Ubuntu (Linux), wxPython also could be installed if you download wxGlade (alhough you must install).  :
	sudo apt-get install wxglade 
	sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf

Just a tool to see how different algorithms evolves during the time (now is more close to demo version).

The idea is that is easy to implement new algorithms and see visually how they work.


Basic Entities
==============

Is already more easy to extend to new algorithms.

The basic packages are :

+ algorithms

	- Implementation of core algorithms. It uses objects in the 'common_entities' package.
	

+ common_entities

	- fitness_algorithm : Is the nexus between the GUI and algorithm simulator. Also it manages the 
						parameters that must be passed to the algorithms (and decouble among the view part).
						Know how manage the population and when a algorithm converges.
						Its objects are responsible of manage the parameters of algorithms.
	
	- population :  Contain the basic object of the dynamic entities such as individuals, and
					some control about them (they could generate new individuals, update population, etc.)
	
	- terrain : Is the proper landscape. It contains also the function to maximize(minimize).
				

+ functions 
	- Class FunctionsXY (package that contains all functions -and also produces random ones
	                     also contains core facilities to try and add new ones.)-
	                    

Note that the unique algorithm that is mandatory if we have to heritance is the object Fitness_algorithm
of the package 'common_entities'.
The other objects could vary.



Future work
===========
There are several core ideas to implement :
	- Add a config panel to parametrize the diferent methods.
	- Add a "rec" button to record some kind of simulation.
	- Add a export operation (to export the simulation to html, for example, using google chart)
	
.. and of course, improve the existing ones and implement new algorithms as well! :)

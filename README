Project to simulate genetic and macroevolutionary algorithms
============================================================

Platform to simulate algorithms to maximize/minimize functions using AI techniques.
(Beta release, just educative package)

To execute this application be sure that you have installed  :
	python+2.7
	python-scitools
	python-matplotlib
	wxPython
	wxGTK2.8
	
In Ubuntu (Linux), wxPython also could be installed if you download wxGlade (alhough you must install).  :
	sudo apt-get install wxglade 
	sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf

Just a tool to see how different algorithms evolves during the time (now is more close to demo version).

The idea is that is easy to implement new algorithms and see visually how they work.

Future work
===========
There are several core ideas to implement :
	- Add a config panel to parametrize the diferent methods.
	- Add a "rec" button to record some kind of simulation.
	- Add a export operation (to export the simulation to html, for example, using google chart)
	
.. and of course, improve the existing ones and implement new algorithms as well! :)

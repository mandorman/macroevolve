\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}
    Population genetic algorithm requires new attributes
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Gets new generation
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Randomly chooses the individuals to be mutated according to the corresponding
    argument
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Mutates the individual object and returns it.
    It must calculate the fitness for the new mutated individual.
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Randomly choose 'X' individuals from the population (according to the corresponding argument).
    Selection allows repetition of individuals. Selection is performed according to probability
    to reproduce from each individual according to its fitness.
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Scales the fitness of each individual according to the population fitness
    to calculate its probability to reproduce
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Return the maximum fitness value.
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Return the minimum fitness value.
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Computes the average fitness of the population.
    It computes the aritmetic mean of the fitness of the individuals in the population
    It may be overriden by descendants.
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    calculate the dispersion of the fitness from all the generation individuals
    it is used for stopping the genetic algortihm due to convergence criteria
    \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}
    Sorts the population by descending fitness.
    It may be overriden by descendants.
    \end{DoxyVerb}
